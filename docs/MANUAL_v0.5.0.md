## Precautions
- Currently, it is a minimal implementation that can be used for sessions.
- This is an alpha version. It is quite likely that bugs remain.
- Error handling is lax.
- A warning message appears on the console, but since there is no problem with the operation, it has been left alone for the time being.
- We have not tested the compatibility with the mod. It is compatible with "Dice So Nice!
- The layout has not been validated in English.
- Limited permissions for NPCs and monsters, icons and images will not be changed.
- Combat has not been implemented. We recommend that you take the initiative regarding the order of actions or install mods.
- An example of a mod that supports the order of action (I personally think that Popcorn Initiative is suited for this)
  - Popcorn type "Lancer Initiative" and "Just Popcorn Initiative
  - Group type "Group Initiative" and "Combat Tracker Extensions"
